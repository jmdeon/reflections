When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

-When you would like to collaborate on a project with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-You may be in the middle of working on a feature, and you want to make sure
-said feature works before any new code is pulled.
