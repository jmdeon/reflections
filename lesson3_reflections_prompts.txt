When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

-When you would like to collaborate on a project with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-You may be in the middle of working on a feature, and you want to make sure
-said feature works before any new code is pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

-forks: Used when you do not have permission to alter someone's code on github.
-Forking makes a clone of the repo on GitHub under your name.
-clone: Simply copies all files in one repo into a new one.
-branch: Used within a repo to divert commit history into a new direction.
-Used when you want to maintain original code while adding a new feature to
-the new branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

-Having a copy of the last known state of the remote allows you to diff and
-merge code together even when offline. If you know you're about to go offline,
-you can fetch real quick, then work locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

-I suppose I would simply take turns working on code with another person, each
-having different time alloted so as not to have conflicts with code. 
-Fighting over time slots would be a huge challenge and this method would not
-be very efficient at all, but at least merging conflicts would never happen.
