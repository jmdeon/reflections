What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-The current directory seems to be made into a repository by adding a directory
-called .git which stores a bunch of metadata about said repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

-The staging area seems to be a middle-ground between the working directory
-and the repository. It makes it so you have more control over exactly what you
-want added to the repo with each commit, so that the commit can be as logical
-a change as possible.
